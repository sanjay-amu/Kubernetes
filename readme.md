**Kubernetes Architecture & Design: Interview-Focused Guide**

---

### 🔧 Core Kubernetes Architecture

#### 🧠 What is the Kubernetes Control Plane?

The control plane is the brain of the Kubernetes cluster. It includes the components responsible for global decisions about the cluster (e.g., scheduling), as well as detecting and responding to cluster events.

**Control Plane Components:**

* **API Server:** The front door to the cluster. Accepts REST requests and serves as the communication hub for all components.
* **etcd:** A distributed key-value store that stores all cluster data (desired and observed state). It acts as the single source of truth.
* **Scheduler:** Assigns new pods to appropriate nodes based on resource availability, affinity rules, taints/tolerations, etc.
* **Controller Manager:** Hosts various controllers like the ReplicaSet Controller, Deployment Controller, Node Controller, etc. These continuously reconcile actual state with desired state.

**Worker Node Components:**

* **kubelet:** Runs on each node. Ensures containers are running and healthy.
* **kube-proxy:** Maintains network rules and handles service traffic routing.
* **Container Runtime:** e.g., containerd, CRI-O. Responsible for running containers.

**Example Use Case:**

* Deploying a microservice via a Deployment spec results in:

  * API server storing the new spec.
  * Deployment controller creating or updating a ReplicaSet.
  * Scheduler assigning pods to nodes.
  * kubelet launching containers and reporting back status.

---

### 🔁 Desired vs Actual State Reconciliation

Kubernetes uses a declarative approach. You define the desired state in YAML or through `kubectl apply`, and Kubernetes ensures that the actual state of the cluster matches it.

**Reconciliation Process:**

1. The user applies a Deployment YAML.
2. The API server stores the desired state in etcd.
3. The controller (e.g., Deployment controller) detects the change.
4. If there's a difference from the actual state, it creates a new ReplicaSet.
5. New pods are scheduled and launched; old ones are terminated gradually.

**Diagram:**

```
User ➝ kubectl apply ➝ API Server ➝ etcd
                               ⬇
                Controller watches for changes
                               ⬇
          Create/update ReplicaSet ➝ Create Pods
                               ⬇
                Scheduler ➝ kubelet ➝ Container Runtime
```

**Interview Tip:** Reconciliation is what enables Kubernetes' "self-healing" nature.

---

### ⚡ High Availability and Failover

**etcd HA:**

* Runs in odd-number quorum (e.g., 3, 5, or 7 members).
* Cluster remains available as long as quorum (majority) is maintained.

**API Server HA:**

* Multiple instances behind a load balancer.
* Clients (kubectl, controllers) connect via load balancer.

**Controller/Scheduler HA:**

* Run in active-passive leader election mode.
* Failover is automatic if a leader node crashes.

**If etcd is unavailable:**

* API Server can't read/write state.
* Controllers can't make decisions.
* The cluster becomes read-only.
* Running pods remain active, but no changes (scheduling, scaling) occur.

**Use Case:**

* During etcd outage in a PCI-compliant fintech app, payments continue but new instances of payment processing pods can't be scheduled.

---

### 🏛️ Controller Manager & Built-In Controllers

The `kube-controller-manager` runs multiple independent control loops:

**Key Controllers:**

* **ReplicaSet Controller:** Maintains desired pod replica count.
* **Deployment Controller:** Handles rollout and rollback of application versions.
* **StatefulSet Controller:** Manages pods that require stable identity and storage.
* **Node Controller:** Monitors node health and handles pod eviction.
* **ServiceAccount Controller:** Creates default service accounts.
* **Job/CronJob Controllers:** Manage one-time or scheduled job execution.

**Interview Scenario:**

> “You’ve deployed an app with 5 replicas. 2 pods crash. How does Kubernetes react?”

* ReplicaSet controller detects deviation.
* Automatically spins up 2 new pods to match desired count.

---

### 🏗️ Pod Lifecycle (from `kubectl apply` to Running)

1. Apply YAML with `kubectl apply`.
2. API Server stores spec in etcd.
3. Deployment Controller compares and creates ReplicaSet.
4. ReplicaSet launches Pods.
5. Scheduler assigns them to appropriate nodes.
6. Kubelet starts containers.
7. Readiness/liveness probes are checked.
8. Once new pods are ready, old pods are gracefully terminated.

**Interview Tip:** Mention rolling updates and readiness gates. During updates, both old and new pods might coexist briefly.

---

### 🔐 Design & Production Considerations

#### ✅ Secrets & Configs

* **Secrets**: Base64-encoded by default (not encrypted).
* Use tools like **SealedSecrets**, **Vault**, or cloud KMS integrations.
* Avoid secrets in plain YAML; use references.

#### ✅ Multi-Tenancy & Isolation

* Use **Namespaces** to segment teams or workloads.
* Combine with **RBAC** for access control.
* Add **NetworkPolicies** for traffic isolation.
* Use **ResourceQuotas** and **LimitRanges** to prevent resource abuse.

#### ✅ Deployment Strategies

* **Recreate**: Stop all old pods, then start new ones.
* **RollingUpdate**: Default; gradually replaces pods.
* **Blue-Green**: Two environments; switch traffic.
* **Canary**: Partial rollout; observe, then proceed.

**Code Snippet – Canary via labels:**

```yaml
selector:
  matchLabels:
    version: v1
---
selector:
  matchLabels:
    version: v2
```

#### ✅ Scaling AI/Fintech Workloads

* Use **HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)** for CPU/memory based scaling.
* Use **KEDA** for event-based scaling (queue length, Kafka, etc.).
* **Taints/Tolerations** for scheduling pods on GPU-specific nodes.
* **Affinity rules** for co-locating services.

#### ✅ Disaster Recovery & Backup

* Periodic **etcd snapshots** stored off-cluster.
* Use GitOps tools (ArgoCD/Flux) for stateless restoration.
* Store YAML manifests in Git for reproducibility.

**Example Interview Scenario:**

> "You’re running a real-time fraud detection ML model on Kubernetes. How do you ensure availability and scale?"

* Use StatefulSet for model server if persistent.
* Enable GPU nodes with taints + tolerations.
* Auto-scale with HPA/KEDA.
* Use Liveness/Readiness probes.
* Expose via Ingress + TLS.

---

### 🌐 Exposing Services & Ingress

**Service Types:**

* **ClusterIP**: Default, internal-only
* **NodePort**: Exposes on static port across nodes
* **LoadBalancer**: Cloud-based external LB
* **Headless**: No cluster IP; used with StatefulSet

**Ingress Controller:**

* Routes HTTP(S) traffic based on paths/hosts
* TLS termination supported
* NGINX, Traefik, HAProxy are common controllers

**Code Example – Ingress:**

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: myapp.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: my-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

---

Absolutely — let’s walk through how to implement each Kubernetes deployment strategy via YAML, specifying exactly:
	•	Which YAML file to edit
	•	Which section to modify
	•	And provide a concrete example for each

⸻

🔁 1. Recreate Strategy

✅ YAML File:

Edit your deployment.yaml file.

🔧 Section to Modify:

spec:
  strategy:
    type: Recreate

📄 Full Example:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: my-image:latest


⸻

🔄 2. RollingUpdate Strategy (default)

✅ YAML File:

Edit your deployment.yaml

🔧 Section to Modify:

spec:
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 25%
      maxUnavailable: 25%

📄 Full Example:

spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 0

This allows 1 extra Pod during rollout while keeping all existing ones running.

⸻

🔵 3. Blue-Green Strategy (manual via separate Deployments)

✅ Files Needed:
	•	deployment-blue.yaml
	•	deployment-green.yaml
	•	service.yaml

🔧 Key Part:

Create two deployments (with different labels) and switch the selector in the Service.

📄 Example deployment-blue.yaml:

metadata:
  name: my-app-blue
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
        version: blue

📄 Example deployment-green.yaml:

metadata:
  name: my-app-green
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
        version: green

📄 Example service.yaml:

spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
    version: green  # 👈 switch from blue to green here

You manually flip the version label in the service selector to switch traffic.

⸻

🐤 4. Canary Strategy (manual or via tools like Argo Rollouts)

✅ Files Needed:
	•	deployment-v1.yaml
	•	deployment-v2.yaml
	•	Optional: Ingress with header-based routing or Argo Rollout CR

🔧 Strategy:
	•	Deploy v1 with label version: stable
	•	Deploy v2 with label version: canary
	•	Split traffic in Ingress (manually or via service mesh)

📄 Example Deployments:

# deployment-v1.yaml
metadata:
  name: my-app-stable
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
        version: stable

# deployment-v2.yaml
metadata:
  name: my-app-canary
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
        version: canary

📄 Example NGINX Ingress Traffic Split:

nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary: "true"
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-weight: "10"

Or use Argo Rollouts with a CRD:

apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Rollout
metadata:
  name: my-rollout
spec:
  strategy:
    canary:
      steps:
        - setWeight: 20
        - pause: { duration: 2m }


⸻

🧠 Summary Table:

Strategy	File	Section to Modify	Tools Needed
Recreate	deployment.yaml	spec.strategy.type: Recreate	None
RollingUpdate	deployment.yaml	spec.strategy.type: RollingUpdate	None
Blue-Green	2 deployments + 1 service	Service spec.selector.version	Manual switch
Canary	2 deployments + Ingress OR Argo Rollout	Ingress annotations or Argo spec	Ingress / ArgoCD

Excellent — let’s build a structured answer set for each of the Kubernetes interview questions. I’ll format them for easy reading, memorization, and revision. We’ll begin with the first 5 core architecture questions today, and I can continue with the rest in batches if you’d like.

⸻

🧠 Core Architecture & High Availability

⸻

1. How does Kubernetes ensure high availability at both the control plane and worker node levels?

Answer:
	•	Control Plane HA:
	•	Multiple API servers behind a load balancer
	•	etcd in a 3/5-member quorum-based cluster
	•	Controller Manager and Scheduler run in leader election mode
	•	Worker Node HA:
	•	Applications use Deployments or ReplicaSets with multiple replicas
	•	If a node fails, kubelet stops responding, and the Node Controller marks the node NotReady
	•	Pods are automatically rescheduled on healthy nodes

“Kubernetes achieves high availability by replicating critical control plane components and ensuring the worker nodes are monitored and dynamically recover workloads using self-healing controllers.”

⸻

2. What are the failure scenarios in etcd and how would you design for resiliency?

Answer:
	•	etcd failure types:
	•	Minor: One node fails in a 3-node cluster → still operational (quorum maintained)
	•	Major: Quorum lost → entire control plane becomes read-only
	•	Resiliency design:
	•	Always deploy in odd-member quorum (3, 5, 7)
	•	Place members in different availability zones
	•	Enable automated snapshots and off-cluster backups
	•	Use managed etcd (e.g., via EKS, GKE) for operational simplicity

“Loss of etcd quorum halts all writes to the cluster, so resilience comes from quorum design, geographic separation, and regular backups.”

⸻

3. How would you architect Kubernetes for a global-scale, multi-region application (e.g., a financial API)?

Answer:
	•	Multi-cluster setup: Deploy regional clusters (e.g., us-east-1, eu-west-1)
	•	Use federation or service mesh for cross-cluster routing
	•	Implement CDN + GeoDNS at the global ingress level
	•	Use GitOps (ArgoCD/Flux) for centralized, version-controlled app delivery
	•	Data locality: Deploy services close to where the data and customers are
	•	Cross-region failover: Use automation to detect outage and shift traffic

“For financial-grade apps, multi-region Kubernetes means isolated, redundant clusters with global routing and GitOps-based consistency.”

⸻

4. In what scenarios would you consider using managed Kubernetes (e.g., EKS, GKE, AKS) vs self-managed?

Answer:
Use managed K8s when:
	•	You want to reduce operational overhead (patching, upgrades)
	•	You prioritize faster time to market
	•	You’re already in a supported cloud ecosystem (AWS, Azure, GCP)
	•	You need built-in cloud-native integrations (IAM, load balancers, etc.)

Use self-managed K8s when:
	•	You need fine-grained control over every layer
	•	You’re in on-prem or hybrid environments
	•	You must comply with strict regulatory or air-gapped conditions

“Managed Kubernetes simplifies ops for most teams, but self-managed gives you control and customization when the environment demands it.”

⸻

5. What’s your backup and disaster recovery strategy for etcd and persistent volumes?

Answer:
	•	etcd Backup:
	•	Use etcdctl snapshot save on a cron schedule
	•	Store backups in off-cluster, versioned object storage (e.g., S3, GCS)
	•	Validate restoration using etcdctl snapshot restore in test clusters
	•	PV Backup:
	•	Use CSI drivers that support volume snapshotting
	•	Integrate with tools like Velero, Stash, or cloud-native backup solutions
	•	Apply retention, encryption, and regional replication for disaster scenarios

“A robust backup strategy means versioned, encrypted, off-cluster copies of both etcd and storage volumes — tested regularly and tied to incident response plans.”

⸻

Perfect! Here is the next batch of Kubernetes interview questions (6–10) focused on Application Design & Workload Management, with structured answers designed for senior DevOps, Architect, or CTO-level roles.

⸻

🚀 Application Design & Workload Management

⸻

6. How do you choose between Deployments, StatefulSets, and DaemonSets for various workloads?

Answer:

Workload Type	Controller	When to Use
Deployment	Deployment	Stateless apps (web servers, APIs), where identity isn’t needed
StatefulSet	StatefulSet	Stateful apps (DBs, Kafka, ML models) needing stable identity or storage
DaemonSet	DaemonSet	Cluster-level agents/log collectors (Prometheus Node Exporter, Fluentd)

	•	Deployment uses ReplicaSets and allows rolling updates and autoscaling.
	•	StatefulSet maintains sticky identity (e.g., pod-0, pod-1) and persistent storage per pod.
	•	DaemonSet ensures exactly one pod per node, used for node-level tasks.

“We select controllers based on workload nature—stateful or stateless—and whether pod identity or node affinity is required.”

⸻

7. Explain how rolling updates work in Kubernetes. How would you mitigate risk during critical deployments?

Answer:

Rolling Update (default strategy for Deployments):
	•	Replaces pods gradually
	•	Configurable via maxUnavailable and maxSurge
	•	Ensures new pods become ready before old ones terminate

Risk Mitigation Strategies:
	•	Use readiness probes to avoid routing traffic to unhealthy pods
	•	Use maxUnavailable=0 to ensure full availability
	•	Monitor metrics/logs (e.g., using Prometheus, Grafana)
	•	Combine with canary strategy for gradual exposure

strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxUnavailable: 0
    maxSurge: 1

“Rolling updates minimize downtime by default, but probes, canaries, and observability are essential to mitigate production risk.”

⸻

8. What are your preferred deployment strategies (e.g., blue-green, canary) and why?

Answer:

Strategy	Pros	When to Use
Rolling	No downtime, built-in	Most stateless services
Blue-Green	Easy rollback, isolated environments	Critical APIs, compliance-heavy apps
Canary	Minimal risk, gradual exposure	ML models, pricing engines, fraud detection

	•	Blue-Green: Run two full environments and switch traffic instantly.
	•	Canary: Release to a small percentage, monitor, then ramp up.
	•	Use Argo Rollouts or Flagger for progressive delivery.

“I often use canary + Argo Rollouts for AI and fintech features to validate production behavior safely.”

⸻

9. How would you scale a machine learning inference service deployed on Kubernetes?

Answer:
	•	Package model as a container (e.g., FastAPI + model weights)
	•	Use StatefulSet (if model loads into memory) or Deployment (stateless inference)
	•	Deploy on GPU-enabled nodes using:
	•	Taints/Tolerations to isolate GPU workloads
	•	Node selectors or affinity rules
	•	Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for CPU/memory-based scaling
	•	Use KEDA if scaling based on queue depth (Kafka, Redis, SQS)

“ML services need GPU scheduling, smart autoscaling, and lifecycle awareness. KEDA helps when autoscaling needs are event-driven.”

⸻

10. Describe how you would manage an update that includes a DB schema change along with a backend rollout.

Answer:
	•	Break down the rollout into phases:
	1.	Backward-compatible schema migration (e.g., add new column)
	2.	Deploy new backend that can work with old + new schema
	3.	Switch traffic gradually (canary/rolling)
	4.	Finalize schema change (e.g., remove old column)
	•	Use pre/post hooks or init containers for migrations
	•	Leverage Helm for controlled, templated updates
	•	Rollback = revert app and schema using Flyway/Liquibase or migration tooling

“For zero-downtime DB schema updates, I always ensure backward compatibility, staggered rollout, and automation for migration/rollback.”

⸻
Great — here’s the next set of Kubernetes interview Q&A tailored for CTO, Architect, or DevOps roles, covering Security & Compliance (especially relevant in fintech or regulated industries).

⸻

🔐 Security & Compliance (Questions 11–15)

⸻

11. How would you secure sensitive data (e.g., credentials, API keys) inside Kubernetes?

Answer:
	•	Use Kubernetes Secrets to store sensitive data (e.g., passwords, tokens)
	•	Ensure etcd is:
	•	Encrypted at rest via encryptionConfiguration file
	•	Backed up securely (off-cluster, encrypted)
	•	Avoid secrets in plain text YAML or environment variables
	•	Mount secrets as volumes with restricted permissions (e.g., readOnly: true)
	•	For advanced setups:
	•	Use SealedSecrets (Bitnami) to encrypt secrets in Git
	•	Use HashiCorp Vault or cloud KMS (AWS KMS, GCP KMS) for dynamic secrets

“In production, I combine Secrets encryption at rest, sealed secrets for GitOps, and external vaulting systems for rotation and audit logging.”

⸻

12. What are PodSecurityPolicies, and what replaced them in recent Kubernetes versions?

Answer:
	•	PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) was a built-in admission controller that defined rules for what pods could run (e.g., user ID, host networking, privilege escalation)
	•	As of Kubernetes v1.25, PSP is deprecated and removed
	•	Replacements:
	•	OPA/Gatekeeper with Rego policies
	•	Kyverno – policy engine with Kubernetes-native syntax
	•	Pod Security Admission (PSA) – built-in to K8s for privileged, baseline, and restricted levels

pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: restricted

“We now use Kyverno and PSA together to enforce fine-grained, namespace-level security policies in a maintainable way.”

⸻

13. How do you enforce multi-tenancy isolation in a shared cluster?

Answer:

To isolate workloads and teams:
	1.	Namespaces:
	•	Separate environments/apps per namespace
	•	Use resource quotas to limit usage per team
	2.	RBAC:
	•	Define roles and rolebindings scoped to namespaces
	•	Least privilege principle for users and service accounts
	3.	NetworkPolicies:
	•	Restrict communication between namespaces or workloads
	•	Default-deny policy with only required exceptions
	4.	PodSecurity (PSA):
	•	Enforce security baselines per namespace
	5.	Optional:
	•	Use OPA/Gatekeeper or Kyverno for compliance

“I design multi-tenancy using a combination of namespaces, quotas, network policies, and strict RBAC — like virtual clusters on a shared backbone.”

⸻

14. What is your approach to implementing TLS everywhere in the cluster?

Answer:
	•	Ingress TLS:
	•	Use Ingress Controller (e.g., NGINX) with TLS termination
	•	Automate certs with cert-manager + Let’s Encrypt or private CA
	•	Internal TLS:
	•	Use Service Mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) for automatic mTLS between pods
	•	If mesh is overkill, use libraries within apps or run Envoy sidecars
	•	etcd and API Server:
	•	Ensure all control plane and etcd communication is TLS-encrypted
	•	Rotate certificates using cert-manager or custom cert lifecycle automation

“For full-stack TLS, I use cert-manager + Ingress for external, and mTLS via Istio for internal pod-to-pod communication.”

⸻

15. How do you ensure your Kubernetes cluster is PCI-DSS or SOC 2 compliant?

Answer:
	•	Network Isolation:
	•	Use namespaces + NetworkPolicies
	•	Isolate sensitive workloads (e.g., card processing) from less-trusted ones
	•	Audit Logging:
	•	Enable API server audit logs
	•	Forward logs to SIEM (e.g., Splunk, ELK)
	•	Access Control:
	•	Enforce RBAC, use OAuth/OpenID integration
	•	Use short-lived tokens, disable anonymous access
	•	Secrets Management:
	•	Encrypt at rest, rotate regularly
	•	Prefer Vault or KMS for dynamic secrets
	•	Image Security:
	•	Use signed images (Cosign), scan with Trivy, Clair, or Aqua
	•	Enforce policies via OPA/Gatekeeper
	•	CI/CD Compliance:
	•	GitOps with signed commits (Sigstore)
	•	Enforce approvals before production deployment

“I align cluster setup with CIS Kubernetes Benchmarks, use OPA/Kyverno for policy enforcement, and ensure all activities are auditable for PCI/SOC2 needs.”

⸻
Excellent! Let’s continue with questions 16–20, focused on Networking & Service Exposure in Kubernetes — key areas for both DevOps and platform architects.

⸻

🌐 Networking & Service Exposure (Questions 16–20)

⸻

16. Compare ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, and Ingress. When would you use each?

Answer:

Type	Description	Use Case
ClusterIP	Default; internal-only IP for services	Inter-pod communication inside cluster
NodePort	Exposes service on static port on all nodes	Dev/test setups or direct IP access
LoadBalancer	Uses external cloud provider LB (AWS ELB, etc.)	Public-facing apps in cloud
Ingress	Layer 7 HTTP/S routing to internal services	Host/path-based routing with TLS

“For internal microservice communication, I use ClusterIP. For external access, I use Ingress + TLS via cert-manager, unless I need raw TCP — then LoadBalancer or NodePort.”

⸻

17. How does Kubernetes internal DNS and service discovery work?

Answer:
	•	Each service gets a DNS name: service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local
	•	Kubernetes adds DNS entries via CoreDNS (default DNS server)
	•	Pods use kube-dns/CoreDNS to resolve service names
	•	Pod-to-service resolution is abstracted:
	•	A request to my-service.default.svc.cluster.local routes to the ClusterIP
	•	IP tables or IPVS handle forwarding to an actual pod (via kube-proxy)

“Kubernetes’ DNS-based discovery simplifies service communication by abstracting IP addresses and supporting dynamic scaling.”

⸻

18. How would you implement fine-grained network segmentation between services?

Answer:
	1.	NetworkPolicies:
	•	Define allowed ingress/egress rules between pods using selectors
	•	By default, all traffic is allowed — so apply default deny policies

kind: NetworkPolicy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: frontend
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: backend

	2.	Namespace-level isolation:
	•	Limit cross-namespace traffic using NetworkPolicies
	3.	Service Mesh (optional):
	•	Use Istio or Linkerd for identity-based, encrypted, policy-driven traffic

“For compliance and security, I use default-deny policies and allow only explicitly whitelisted traffic between tiers.”

⸻

19. What is a service mesh, and when would you introduce one (e.g., Istio, Linkerd)?

Answer:

Service Mesh = Dedicated infrastructure layer for service-to-service communication.

Key Features:
	•	Automatic mTLS for pod-to-pod encryption
	•	Traffic routing (canary, A/B testing, failover)
	•	Retries, timeouts, circuit breakers
	•	Metrics, tracing, observability
	•	Policy enforcement (via OPA or built-in)

Popular Meshes:
	•	Istio – feature-rich, heavy
	•	Linkerd – lightweight, simpler
	•	Consul Connect – integrates well with Vault

When to Use:
	•	Need fine-grained traffic control (e.g., rollout strategies)
	•	Enforcing zero trust networking
	•	Rich telemetry and security auditing

“I use a service mesh when app-level logic like retries and failover need to be consistent and secured across services — especially in fintech or AI pipelines.”

⸻

20. How do you handle traffic shaping, rate limiting, and retries within your cluster?

Answer:
	•	Ingress Controller (NGINX/HAProxy):
	•	Can do basic rate limiting and IP throttling
	•	Example:

nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-connections: "1"
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rpm: "20"


	•	Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd):
	•	Advanced traffic shaping: circuit breaking, retries, mirroring, traffic splitting
	•	Define via CRDs (e.g., VirtualService, DestinationRule in Istio)
	•	API Gateway (e.g., Kong, Ambassador):
	•	Handles authentication, rate limits, quotas, caching
	•	Envoy Proxy:
	•	Standalone or with service mesh — for sophisticated policies

“For deep traffic control, I prefer Istio or Envoy; but for basic needs, NGINX annotations and API gateways work well.”

⸻

✅ You’re now fully covered for Networking/Service-related interview questions.

Awesome! Let’s continue with questions 21–25, covering CI/CD, GitOps, and Observability, followed by 26–50 in upcoming batches.

⸻

🛠️ CI/CD, GitOps & Observability (Questions 21–25)

⸻

21. Describe your GitOps workflow. What tools do you use (e.g., ArgoCD, Flux)?

Answer:
	•	GitOps is a model where Git is the source of truth for both app and infra deployments.
	•	Tools:
	•	ArgoCD: GitOps controller that syncs manifests from Git to the cluster. Great UI and multi-cluster support.
	•	Flux: Lightweight, CLI-friendly GitOps tool, integrates with Helm/Kustomize.

Workflow:
	1.	Dev commits code → triggers CI → builds container image
	2.	CI updates image tag in Git (deployment.yaml)
	3.	ArgoCD detects change, syncs to cluster
	4.	Argo ensures deployment drift detection & rollback

“With GitOps, all changes are auditable, reproducible, and consistent — especially critical for regulated environments like fintech.”

⸻

22. How do you build, test, and deploy container images securely and automatically?

Answer:
	•	CI Pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins):
	•	Lint → Test → Build → Scan → Push → Deploy
	•	Security Steps:
	•	Scan images with tools like Trivy, Grype, or Aqua
	•	Sign images using Cosign/Sigstore
	•	Enforce minimal base images (e.g., distroless, alpine)
	•	Push to private registry (e.g., ECR, GCR, Harbor)
	•	Deploy using ArgoCD, Flux, or Helm with manual approval gates

“Security starts at CI: we block builds on known CVEs, use signed images, and deploy only from trusted pipelines.”

⸻

23. What observability stack do you recommend for Kubernetes and why?

Answer:

My preferred observability stack:

Layer	Tool
Metrics	Prometheus + Grafana
Logs	Loki or ELK stack
Tracing	Jaeger, Tempo, or OpenTelemetry
Alerting	Alertmanager, PagerDuty

	•	Use ServiceMonitors for Prometheus to auto-discover pods
	•	Use Loki for Grafana-native log querying
	•	Use OpenTelemetry SDKs in app for full tracing

“I integrate Prometheus, Loki, and Jaeger into a unified Grafana dashboard with app-specific alerts and SLO tracking.”

⸻

24. How do you trace a slow request through multiple microservices in Kubernetes?

Answer:
	•	Inject trace IDs into HTTP headers (X-Trace-Id) using OpenTelemetry or Jaeger
	•	Instrument code to generate and propagate trace context
	•	Use a Service Mesh (e.g., Istio) to auto-inject sidecar trace collection
	•	Use distributed tracing tools (Jaeger, Tempo) to visualize end-to-end latency

Steps:
	1.	Identify trace ID from client logs
	2.	Search trace in Jaeger UI
	3.	Drill into spans and latency per service
	4.	Correlate with pod metrics/logs for bottleneck

“Tracing shows the latency breakdown across services. I use this for real-time debugging, SLA audits, and performance tuning.”

⸻

25. What tools or techniques do you use to debug a crashing Pod or failing rollout?

Answer:
	1.	Check Pod Status:

kubectl describe pod <pod>


	2.	View Logs:

kubectl logs <pod>
kubectl logs <pod> -c <container>


	3.	Exec into Pod:

kubectl exec -it <pod> -- /bin/sh


	4.	Check Events:

kubectl get events --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'


	5.	Debug YAML with dry-run:

kubectl apply -f file.yaml --dry-run=client



Advanced Tools:
	•	Lens, K9s for cluster introspection
	•	Stern, kubetail for streaming logs
	•	Prometheus alerts for real-time crash loops

“My workflow combines describe, logs, events, and custom alerts. Most failures stem from config issues, probes, or imagePull errors.”

⸻

Awesome! Here’s the next batch — Questions 26–30, focused on Real-World Troubleshooting Scenarios in Kubernetes. These are practical issues that often arise in production environments and are frequently brought up in architecture, DevOps, or SRE interviews.

⸻

🧪 Real-World Troubleshooting & Scenarios (Questions 26–30)

⸻

26. You’ve applied a Deployment update, but the new Pods are stuck in CrashLoopBackOff. What’s your approach?

Answer:
	1.	Check Pod status & reason:

kubectl describe pod <pod>

Look for: OOMKilled, ImagePullBackOff, permission denied, etc.

	2.	Get container logs:

kubectl logs <pod> -c <container>


	3.	Look for readiness/liveness probe failures:
	•	May cause premature restarts
	4.	Check resource limits:
	•	CPU/memory too low?
	5.	Exec into pod (if possible):

kubectl exec -it <pod> -- /bin/sh


	6.	Rollback if needed:

kubectl rollout undo deployment <name>



“CrashLoopBackOff typically means app-level errors. I use logs, describe, and sometimes live debugging with exec or kubectl debug.”

⸻

27. A node becomes NotReady during peak hours. How would you detect and respond to this automatically?

Answer:
	1.	Detection:
	•	Kubernetes marks node NotReady after missed heartbeats
	•	Triggered via Node Controller
	•	Use Prometheus alert:

kube_node_status_condition{condition="Ready",status="false"}


	2.	Response:
	•	Use Cluster Autoscaler to add more nodes
	•	Use taints + tolerations to cordon the node
	•	Evict and reschedule pods to healthy nodes
	3.	Automation:
	•	Use Kured (Kubernetes Reboot Daemon) for safe reboots
	•	Use self-healing infrastructure scripts or IaaS integrations

“I rely on alerts + autoscaling to auto-recover from NotReady nodes, and use chaos testing to ensure resilience.”

⸻

28. You notice a spike in 500 errors during a canary rollout. What’s your immediate next step?

Answer:
	1.	Pause the rollout:

kubectl rollout pause deployment <name>


	2.	Analyze metrics:
	•	Use Prometheus + Grafana or Argo Rollouts dashboard
	•	Filter logs and latency/error % per pod or revision
	3.	Compare old vs new pod logs:

kubectl logs <pod-new>
kubectl logs <pod-old>


	4.	Inspect application metrics:
	•	Did probes fail? Did DB connections spike?
	5.	Roll back if needed:

kubectl rollout undo deployment <name>



“During a spike, I pause the rollout immediately and inspect logs/metrics per version. Canary lets me minimize blast radius.”

⸻

29. Persistent volumes aren’t unmounting after Pod deletion. What could cause this and how would you resolve it?

Answer:

Possible Causes:
	•	Pod using volume is stuck in Terminating state
	•	Finalizers not cleared from volume or pod
	•	Volume is still in use by another pod or process
	•	CSI driver bugs or unresponsive cloud disk APIs

Resolution Steps:
	1.	Check PVC and PV status:

kubectl get pvc,pv


	2.	Manually delete finalizers (last resort):

kubectl patch pvc <name> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":null}}'


	3.	Reboot node or clean mount points (carefully)
	4.	Restart CSI driver or check cloud disk attachments

“Stuck PVs usually relate to dangling mounts or finalizers. I carefully patch metadata or restart drivers when safe.”

⸻

30. How do you control cost and prevent resource abuse in a multi-team Kubernetes cluster?

Answer:
	1.	Namespaces per team to logically separate workloads
	2.	Resource Quotas to limit usage:

kind: ResourceQuota
spec:
  hard:
    cpu: "10"
    memory: "20Gi"


	3.	LimitRanges to enforce pod-level limits:

kind: LimitRange
spec:
  limits:
  - default:
      cpu: "500m"
      memory: "1Gi"


	4.	Monitor usage via Prometheus, Kubecost, or Cloud Billing dashboards
	5.	Pre-emptible/spot instances for non-critical workloads

“I use namespaces + quotas to enforce boundaries, and tooling like Kubecost to show teams real-time spending and accountability.”

⸻
Perfect! Let’s move to the next set — Questions 31–35, which cover advanced topics like security policies, multi-cluster setup, resiliency, and real-world architecture — essential for CTO, platform architect, or DevOps leadership roles.

⸻

🛡️ Advanced Security, Resiliency & Multi-Cluster Ops (Questions 31–35)

⸻

31. How do you control which container images are allowed to run in your cluster?

Answer:

Multiple layers of image security:
	1.	Admission Controllers:
	•	Use Gatekeeper (OPA) or Kyverno with policies like:
	•	Only allow images from approved-registry.com
	•	Block :latest tags
	•	Require image signatures
	2.	Image Scanning:
	•	Scan with Trivy, Anchore, or Aqua
	•	Automate scans in CI/CD pipelines
	3.	Image Signing & Verification:
	•	Use Sigstore (Cosign) to sign images
	•	Enforce verification using Kyverno or OPA
	4.	Runtime Policies:
	•	Use Falco or Sysdig to detect image anomalies at runtime

“We enforce signed, scanned images from trusted registries using Kyverno and Cosign — no image runs unless it’s explicitly approved.”

⸻

32. How would you design a multi-cluster Kubernetes environment and why?

Answer:

Use multi-cluster when:
	•	Teams, regions, or compliance domains need separation
	•	Apps need geo-distribution (e.g., low latency trading in NY + London)

Design choices:
	•	Use separate clusters per environment or region (e.g., EKS us-east-1, us-west-2)
	•	Use ArgoCD or Flux for multi-cluster GitOps delivery
	•	Cluster registry or mesh (e.g., Istio multi-cluster, Submariner, Skupper) for service discovery

Service Routing:
	•	Global Ingress or DNS-based failover via Cloudflare, Route 53
	•	Optional service mesh with shared root CA for identity

“Multi-cluster design isolates failure domains, simplifies compliance, and enables global app delivery with GitOps consistency.”

⸻

33. What’s your strategy for handling Kubernetes upgrades in production clusters?

Answer:
	1.	Version Strategy:
	•	Stay within N-1 or N-2 versions
	•	Track deprecations before upgrading
	2.	Upgrade Approach:
	•	Start with non-prod clusters
	•	Upgrade control plane first (managed via EKS/GKE)
	•	Upgrade worker nodes (rolling, cordon & drain)
	3.	Automation:
	•	Use kubeadm, eksctl, or managed tools
	•	Back up etcd and YAML manifests before upgrade
	4.	Validation:
	•	Run smoke tests and probe health
	•	Use canary nodes to test upgrades with live traffic

“I plan upgrades quarterly, simulate in staging, then roll forward in waves with health checks and full observability.”

⸻

34. What happens if a node running critical workloads crashes? How does Kubernetes recover?

Answer:
	1.	kubelet Heartbeat Fails → Node marked NotReady
	2.	Node Controller waits ~5 minutes, then evicts pods
	3.	Pods rescheduled by ReplicaSet or StatefulSet controllers on healthy nodes
	4.	Volumes:
	•	If using PVCs with dynamic provisioning (e.g., AWS EBS), they reattach automatically to new node
	5.	Pods with local-only storage or node affinity may not reschedule

Best Practices:
	•	Spread workloads across zones (anti-affinity)
	•	Use PodDisruptionBudgets and readiness probes
	•	Monitor using Prometheus/Grafana or Kube-state-metrics

“Kubernetes self-heals by design. With good probes, replica sets, and anti-affinity, recovery is automatic and fast.”

⸻

35. How do you enforce consistent configurations (limits, labels, annotations) across teams in a cluster?

Answer:
	1.	Policy Enforcement:
	•	Use Kyverno or OPA/Gatekeeper to enforce:
	•	Required labels (e.g., team, env)
	•	Default resource limits
	•	Mandatory annotations (e.g., owner)
	2.	Namespace Templates:
	•	Use Helm charts or Kustomize to enforce pre-approved templates per namespace/team
	3.	Admission Webhooks:
	•	Use mutating/validating webhooks to auto-add or validate required fields
	4.	GitOps Delivery:
	•	Deploy baseline config via ArgoCD (LimitRanges, NetworkPolicies)

Example Kyverno Policy:

match:
  resources:
    kinds: ["Pod"]
validate:
  message: "Memory limit is required"
  pattern:
    spec:
      containers:
        - resources:
            limits:
              memory: "?*"

“We codify platform standards with Kyverno and GitOps — teams ship fast, but stay inside guardrails.”

⸻

Great! Let’s move into Questions 36–40, covering advanced concepts like Service Mesh, Persistent Storage, Stateful apps, and Operator patterns — topics often discussed at architect or CTO level interviews.

⸻

🔄 Advanced Workloads, Service Mesh, and Storage (Questions 36–40)

⸻

36. When would you introduce a service mesh in your Kubernetes environment?

Answer:

I’d introduce a service mesh when:
	•	You need zero-trust networking with automatic mTLS between services
	•	You want to control traffic routing for canary, blue-green, or A/B rollouts
	•	You need centralized observability (tracing, metrics, logging) across microservices
	•	You want to offload retries, circuit breaking, and timeouts from application logic

Tools:
	•	Istio: Feature-rich, great for enterprises
	•	Linkerd: Lightweight, simpler adoption
	•	Consul Connect: Integrates well with HashiCorp Vault

“I deploy a service mesh when security, visibility, or rollout safety across services becomes too complex to manage in app code.”

⸻

37. How do you manage persistent storage in Kubernetes for stateful applications?

Answer:
	1.	Use PVC + PV abstraction:
	•	PVC is a claim; PV is the actual storage
	•	Use dynamic provisioning via CSI drivers
	2.	Storage Classes:
	•	Define classes with backend-specific configs (e.g., SSD vs HDD, IOPS tiers)
	3.	For Stateful Apps:
	•	Use StatefulSet with volumeClaimTemplates
	•	Each pod gets a persistent, sticky volume
	4.	Best practices:
	•	Enable volume snapshots for backups
	•	Use RWX (ReadWriteMany) only if supported and safe
	•	Prefer block storage for DBs, file storage for shared access

“Kubernetes handles state well when PVCs and StorageClasses are aligned to workload needs. I design storage intentionally for availability and performance.”

⸻

38. How do StatefulSets differ from Deployments, and when do you use them?

Answer:

Feature	Deployment	StatefulSet
Pod identity	Ephemeral	Stable (e.g., pod-0)
Storage	Shared or none	Persistent, sticky
Pod ordering	Not guaranteed	Strict (start/stop order)
Use case	Web apps, APIs	DBs, Kafka, Redis, Zookeeper

Use StatefulSets when:
	•	You need stable DNS names, e.g., mysql-0.mysql.default.svc
	•	Each instance needs its own volume
	•	Pod identity matters for replication (DBs, queues)

“StatefulSet is ideal when your app needs identity, stickiness, or peer awareness. It’s a critical pattern for running production-grade databases on K8s.”

⸻

39. How do you perform data backup and recovery in Kubernetes for stateful applications?

Answer:

For Volumes:
	•	Use CSI volume snapshots (native with many cloud providers)
	•	Use tools like Velero, Kasten K10, or Stash
	•	Store backups off-cluster (S3, GCS, etc.) with versioning + encryption

For Databases:
	•	Use in-app mechanisms (e.g., pg_dump, mysqldump, WAL logs)
	•	Schedule via CronJobs or backup sidecars

For etcd:
	•	Take periodic snapshots using etcdctl snapshot save
	•	Restore using etcdctl snapshot restore when needed

Recovery Strategy:
	•	Practice restore in a staging environment regularly
	•	Automate DR runbooks via CI/CD

“I use CSI snapshots + Velero for PVCs, and app-native tools for DBs. Backup is only useful when restores are tested.”

⸻

40. What is the Kubernetes Operator pattern and when should you build one?

Answer:

Kubernetes Operator = Custom controller that codifies domain-specific operational logic into CRDs.

Why use it:
	•	Automates complex app lifecycle tasks (install, upgrade, backup)
	•	Encapsulates human SRE knowledge as code
	•	Enables self-service for platform teams

When to build one:
	•	Managing complex stateful apps (e.g., MongoDB, Kafka, Elastic)
	•	When Helm charts become too brittle or lack lifecycle intelligence
	•	You want to expose custom APIs via CRDs

Tools to build:
	•	Operator SDK (Go)
	•	KUDO
	•	Kopf (Python)

“I use operators to encapsulate repeatable SRE workflows like backup, scaling, or upgrade for databases or platforms. It turns human expertise into repeatable code.”

⸻

Awesome — let’s move on to Questions 41–45, focused on scalability, autoscaling strategies, custom resources, and Kubernetes API extension, which are highly relevant for architect-level or DevOps leadership interviews.

⸻

📈 Scalability, Performance, and Kubernetes APIs (Questions 41–45)

⸻

41. How do you scale workloads in Kubernetes efficiently?

Answer:

Scaling can be achieved at multiple levels:
	1.	Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
	•	Scales pods based on CPU/memory or custom metrics
	•	Uses metrics-server and Prometheus Adapter for external metrics

apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler


	2.	Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)
	•	Recommends or adjusts pod CPU/memory requests
	•	Risk: Causes pod restarts
	3.	Cluster Autoscaler
	•	Scales nodes up/down based on unschedulable pods
	•	Supported by cloud providers (EKS, GKE, AKS)
	4.	Event-driven autoscaling (KEDA)
	•	Scales based on external events: Kafka lag, queue length, SQS messages, etc.

“I use HPA for web apps, KEDA for event-driven workloads, and Cluster Autoscaler to balance node-level resources.”

⸻

42. What are the limits of scaling in Kubernetes and how do you address them?

Answer:

Scaling Limits (roughly):
	•	~5000 nodes per cluster
	•	~100 pods per node (soft limit)
	•	~110 pods/node (default max for kubelet)

Challenges:
	•	etcd performance degradation at scale
	•	Scheduler latency increases with thousands of objects
	•	Networking overhead from too many services/endpoints

Approaches:
	•	Split into multiple clusters (per region/team)
	•	Use node pools for workload types
	•	Apply anti-affinity to spread pods
	•	Enable topology-aware routing for network efficiency
	•	Use endpoint slices for scaling services

“At large scale, I prefer horizontal expansion via multi-cluster, optimize control plane, and monitor etcd performance.”

⸻

43. How do you create and use Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) in Kubernetes?

Answer:

Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) allow you to extend Kubernetes with your own APIs.

Steps to use:
	1.	Define the CRD (schema, versions)
	2.	Apply the CRD using kubectl apply -f crd.yaml
	3.	Create instances of your new resource (kubectl get mycustomresource)
	4.	Optionally write a controller/operator to handle the resource

CRD Example:

apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: backups.mycompany.com
spec:
  group: mycompany.com
  names:
    kind: Backup
    plural: backups
  scope: Namespaced
  versions:
    - name: v1
      served: true
      storage: true

Use cases:
	•	Create custom APIs like Database, MLModel, AppTenant, etc.

“CRDs let us model domain-specific resources as first-class citizens in Kubernetes — foundational for GitOps and platform engineering.”

⸻

44. How does the Kubernetes scheduler work and how can you influence its decisions?

Answer:

Kubernetes Scheduler:
	•	Watches for unscheduled pods
	•	Scores nodes based on:
	•	Resource availability
	•	Affinities/anti-affinities
	•	Taints and tolerations
	•	Topology spread constraints
	•	Custom scheduling policies (via plugins)

Ways to influence scheduling:
	•	NodeSelector:

nodeSelector:
  disktype: ssd


	•	Affinity/Anti-Affinity:

affinity:
  podAntiAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:


	•	Taints & Tolerations:
	•	Taint the node: kubectl taint nodes key=value:NoSchedule
	•	Add toleration to pod to run there
	•	TopologySpreadConstraints:
	•	Spread pods across zones or racks to increase resiliency

“I use anti-affinity for high availability, taints for GPU isolation, and topology constraints to build fault-tolerant architectures.”

⸻

45. How do you monitor and improve pod startup time or application performance in Kubernetes?

Answer:

Monitoring Pod Startup:
	•	Enable startup probes (K8s v1.16+) to monitor cold starts
	•	Use kubectl describe pod to check delay reasons (e.g., image pull, init containers)
	•	Use Events and kubelet logs for debugging

Improvement Tactics:
	•	Use smaller, optimized images (e.g., distroless, scratch)
	•	Pre-pull images on nodes (DaemonSet with image prefetch)
	•	Reduce number of init containers or volumes
	•	Tune CPU/memory limits to avoid throttling

Tools:
	•	Prometheus to monitor container lifecycle durations
	•	Jaeger/Tempo to trace cold vs warm latency
	•	Kube-state-metrics for historical pod phase durations

“I optimize pod startup with lightweight images, aggressive resource tuning, and probe instrumentation — especially for latency-sensitive services.”

⸻

You’re almost done! 🎯 Let’s finish strong with Questions 46–50, focused on real-world Kubernetes design, chaos testing, compliance, and team collaboration — topics that distinguish strong architects and CTO-level engineers.

⸻

“In a fintech/AI stack, I use GitOps + policy-as-code + self-service APIs + GPU-aware scheduling. The platform is both auditable and AI-ready.”

⸻

47. What is Chaos Engineering, and how do you implement it in Kubernetes?

Answer:

Chaos Engineering is about testing how systems behave under unexpected conditions — to build resilience proactively.

Tools:
	•	LitmusChaos (Kubernetes-native)
	•	Chaos Mesh
	•	Gremlin (SaaS)

Chaos Scenarios:
	•	Kill random pods or nodes
	•	Inject network latency or DNS failures
	•	Simulate etcd/API server crashes
	•	Throttle CPU/memory

How to run:
	•	Define experiments as CRDs or YAML
	•	Run in staging first → monitor → alert on regressions
	•	Schedule automated chaos jobs in pipelines

“Chaos engineering is how I validate HA assumptions. We run chaos tests regularly for pod failure, node loss, and dependency timeouts.”

⸻

48. How do you make Kubernetes platforms auditable and compliant for SOC2/PCI/etc.?

Answer:
	1.	Access Control & RBAC:
	•	No anonymous access
	•	Use OIDC/SSO + audit logs on every request
	2.	Secrets Management:
	•	Encrypt etcd at rest
	•	Use external secrets engines (Vault, KMS)
	3.	Network Security:
	•	Enforce NetworkPolicies (default deny)
	•	TLS everywhere (Ingress + internal mTLS)
	4.	Policy & Governance:
	•	Use Kyverno/OPA to enforce naming, labels, security configs
	•	Use ArgoCD for Git-based deployment audits
	5.	Auditing:
	•	Enable Kubernetes audit logs
	•	Integrate with SIEM tools (Splunk, ELK)

“For compliance, I bake controls into the platform: secrets, RBAC, audit logs, image scanning, and GitOps-based traceability.”

⸻

49. How do you ensure teams can work independently in a shared Kubernetes platform?

Answer:
	1.	Namespaces per team/project
	2.	RBAC scoped to namespace
	•	Devs manage deployments; ops manage infra
	3.	ResourceQuotas & LimitRanges
	•	Prevent noisy neighbor issues
	4.	Self-service tooling:
	•	Templates via Helm or Kustomize
	•	ArgoCD application sets per team
	•	Internal developer portal (e.g., Backstage)
	5.	Observability per team:
	•	Labels + dashboards tied to team=xyz

“My job as a platform engineer is to empower dev teams without compromising governance. Guardrails, not gates.”

⸻

50. What are the most important Kubernetes trends and tools you’re excited about?

Answer:

Some trends I’m watching and adopting:
	•	GitOps maturity: ArgoCD, Flux — Infra + app pipelines
	•	Platform Engineering: Backstage + Kubernetes as a product
	•	Policy-as-Code: Kyverno, OPA, and Rego
